{"name":"Programming a Robotic Car","body":"### Introduction\r\nThis is the repository for my homeworks from the Udacity Class CS373: Programming a Robotic Car. The entire code is written in (rather simplistic) Python.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis class, taught by one of the foremost experts in AI, will teach you basic methods in Artificial Intelligence, including: probabilistic inference, computer vision, machine learning, and planning, all with a focus on robotics. Extensive programming examples and assignments will apply these methods in the context of building self-driving cars. You will get a chance to visit, via video, the leading research labs in the field, and meet the scientists and engineers who are building self-driving cars at Stanford and Google.\r\n\r\n### Prerequisites\r\nThe instructor will assume solid knowledge of programming, all programming will be in Python. Knowledge of probability and linear algebra will be helpful.\r\n\r\n### Syllabus\r\n * __WEEK 1__: Basics of probability\r\n \t* Car localization with particle filters\r\n * __WEEK 2__: Gaussians and continuous probability\r\n \t* Tracking other cars with Kalman filters\r\n * __WEEK 3__: Image Processing and Machine Learning\r\n \t* Finding objects in sensor data\r\n * __WEEK 4__: Planning and search\r\n \t* Determining where to drive with A* search\r\n \t* Finding optimal routes with dynamic programming\r\n * __WEEK 5__: Controls\r\n \t* Controlling steering and speeds with PID\r\n * __WEEK 6__: Putting it all together\r\n \t* Programming a self-driving car\r\n * __WEEK 7__: Final Exam\r\n \t* Exam testing your knowledge\r\n\r\n## Done:\r\n * Localization:\r\n \t* Homework 01 - Histogramm Filters\r\n \t* Homework 02 - Kalman Filters\r\n \t* Homework 03 - Particle Filters\r\n * Planning:\r\n    * Homework 04 - A*-Search and Dynamic Programming\r\n * Control:\r\n    * Homework 05 - Smoothing and PID-Control\r\n * SLAM\r\n    * Homework 06 - Online Graph SLAM\r\n * Final Exam\r\n    * Programming Exercise done with Dynamic Programming\r\n\t* Bonus: Answers for Questions 1 through 19 (PDF)\r\n\r\n## Pending:\r\n * Nothing! :-)\r\n\r\n\r\n### How to contact me\r\n * via email: thomasrieder _at_ aon _dot_ at\r\n * via twitter: [My Profile](https://twitter.com/#!/thomasrieder)\r\n  \r\n* * *\r\n### Udacity Class:  \r\n[Udacity CS373 Programming a Robotic Car 2012](http://www.udacity.com/overview/Course/cs373/CourseRev/feb2012 \"Udacity Class\")","tagline":"Udacity Class CS373","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
